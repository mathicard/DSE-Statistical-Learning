## Group Project

### Above the norm

With this project we want to discover whether there exist model that describe how much a country is polluted, and also a method to classify Polluted and Clean countries in US.

- Air Quality Index as a measure of cleaniness of a country
- Many predictors used for the models

## Here we can split the parts
